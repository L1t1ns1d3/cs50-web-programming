# Google Search -> (Done)

- Upper right -> Image search, Advanced Search

- Query Text -> should be centered with rounded corners like the default one.

- Lucky -> Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
